# ConvNet-Network-Image-Classification

In this project, I was motivated to try binary classification of huskies versus wolves. I felt like this would present a unique challenge and provide me with the opportunity to try different modeling strategies. Since huskies inherit many traits from their ancestor, the wolf, I was concerned about whether they could be classified with high accuracy (>90%). I sampled a few images and quickly realized the challenge of this classification problem because I, too, struggled to identify the distinguishing features of the species. I am also curious whether the convolutional network I build can accurately classify my husky, Thena.
